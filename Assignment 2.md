## Introduction
This assignment is based on Chapter 2 of the Discrete Structures course, which covers relations, functions, and recurrence relations. It consists of seven questions that require us to apply what we have learned in class to solve various mathematical problems. The assignment was completed in a group, where we worked together to understand each question and find the correct solutions.
The main aim of this assignment is to help us better understand how relations and functions work, as well as how recurrence relations can be used to describe real situations. By completing this assignment, we were able to practice our problem-solving skills and improve our understanding of the topics covered.

## Summary
Overall, this assignment allowed us to explore different concepts related to relations, functions, and recurrence relations in detail. We solved problems involving properties of relations, equivalence relations, matrices and digraphs, and partial order relations. We also worked with functions by finding inverses, compositions, and determining whether a function is one-to-one or onto.
In addition, we answered questions related to recurrence relations and recursive algorithms, which helped us understand how sequences can be defined and calculated step by step.

## Reflection
While working on this assignment, we faced some challenges, especially when dealing with partial order relations and recurrence questions. However, by discussing the questions as a group and going through examples together, we were able to understand the concepts better. Working in a group made it easier to share ideas and correct mistakes along the way.
