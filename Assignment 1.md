## Introduction
This assignment covers the Set Theory and Logic topic. It consists of six questions that test understanding of sets, set operations, logical equivalence, truth tables, and mathematical proof techniques. The assignment was completed as a group, encouraging collaboration and discussion among members to solve problems accurately and systematically. Each question requires clear explanations, proper use of mathematical laws, and step-by-step calculations. The main objective of this assignment is to strengthen logical reasoning skills.

## Summary
This assignment successfully addressed all six questions related to set theory and logic. The problems involved computing set operations, proving set identities using logical laws, applying principles of counting, translating statements into logical symbols, evaluating compound propositions using truth tables, and constructing a direct proof involving odd and even integers. The assignment demonstrated a clear understanding of core concepts in discrete mathematics. Each solution was written neatly with complete steps, fulfilling the requirements stated in the assignment instructions.

## Reflection
Working on this assignment helped deepen my understanding of how abstract mathematical concepts such as sets and logic are applied in a structured manner. Some questions, especially those involving logical equivalence and proofs, required careful thinking and precise reasoning. Group discussions were helpful in clarifying doubts and correcting misunderstandings.
