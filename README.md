## Reflection

Throughout this course, I developed essential mathematical understanding for computer science, including set theory, relations, functions, and graph theory. I discovered how logic, proofs, and combinatorics play important roles in algorithms and data structures. The lessons encouraged me to think more critically and logically, which helped me solve problems more systematically in both programming and system development.

In my opinion, using more real-world examples and coding-related tasks would make some of the abstract ideas easier to relate to. Overall, I now see how mathematical thinking supports nearly every aspect of computing from database structures to software engineering and I apply these concepts not only in mathematical tasks but also in coding and system design.
